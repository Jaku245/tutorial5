## Acknowledgments
I have already worked with "nodejs" and "express" for the backend development. So, I didn't required many references and code implementation help to develop the backend service.

Although, I went to this refresher [document](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-restful-api-using-node-express-and-mongodb/) which helped me recalled the concepts and best practices which were required [1].
